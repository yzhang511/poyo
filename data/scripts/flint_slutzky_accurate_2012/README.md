Experiment list
------------------------------------------
All are monkey C, center out
_e1: Same data as Stevenson_2011_e1, subject 1
_e2: Same day, subjects are different recording sessions
_e3: Same day, subjects are different recording sessions

_e4: Same day, subjects are different recording sessions
_e5: Same day, subjects are different recording sessions

Data Comments:
------------------------------------------
The Neuron structure in the trial field has timestamps of nuerons that fire.
The EMG is for Biceps, Triceps, Anterior and Posterior Deltoids
LFPs are also present.

Subject 1 did not record EMGs.

File 2 was recorded on July 19, 2010.  File 3 was July 20.  File 4 was Aug 31.  
File 5 was Sept 1.  I'm not sure when File 1 was recorded.

Notes:
------------------------------------------
The first subject of data here is also the first subject for the
Stevenson_2011_e1 data set.  Each experiment is one day's worth of recording.
Each 'Subject' is a different recording session on the same day.

All the data is for one monkey, monkey C in the publication.

"Good" trials are ones that had a target off event.  They still might not 
have a completed reach from target to target, however.

The target position was not recorded during the experiment.  It has been 
estimated and added in.
