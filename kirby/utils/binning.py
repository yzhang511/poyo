    r"""Bins spikes into time bins of size `bin_size`. If the total time spanned by
    the spikes is not a multiple of `bin_size`, the spikes are truncated to the nearest
    multiple of `bin_size`. If `right` is True, the spikes are truncated from the left
    end of the time series, otherwise they are truncated from the right end.

    Note that we cannot infer the number of units from a chunk of spikes, hence why it
    must be provided as an argument.

    Args:
        spikes: IrregularTimeSeries object containing the spikes.
        num_units: Number of units in the population.
        bin_size: Size of the time bins in seconds.
        right: If True, any excess spikes are truncated from the left end of the time
            series. Otherwise, they are truncated from the right end.
